Terminal-based maze game.
Generates Euclidean, spatial, 4D mazes.
For lower-dimensional mazes, enter length of 1 on higher dimensions.
Includes right angle rotation (dimension swapping/d-swap).
Coded mostly from my Android phone using C4droid.

FEATURES:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - random
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first (Prim)
  - hunt & kill
- Maze sovling algorithms:
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first
- Dimesion swapping (4D rotation)
- Multiple print styles:
  - line-of-sight
  - absolute range
  - with or without memory

TO DO:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - Eller
- Tutorials:
  - entering commands (press enter)
  - movement
  - dimension swapping
