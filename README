Last updated: 2014-08-08 | 15:25

Generates Euclidean, spatial, 4D mazes.
Coded mostly from my Android phone using C4droid.

FEATURES:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - random
  - random solved
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first (Prim)
  - hunt & kill
- Maze sovling algorithms:
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first
- Multiple print styles:
  - "line-of-sight"
  - "ranged"
  - "discovery"
- Real-time controls

TO DO:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - Eller
- Dimesion swapping (rotation)

FOR FULL VERSION:
- 3D graphics*
- 3D intersection with convex hull algorithm*

* Already implemented elsewhere**.
** And if you believe that, I have a proof for a^n + b^n != c^n for natural a,b,c and n > 2 that's too big to fit here.
