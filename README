2D nD Maze Game
Author: Geoffrey Card
Last updated: 2014-07-20 | 01:33

Generates Euclidean, spatial, 4D mazes.
For lower-dimensional mazes, enter length of 1 on higher dimensions.
Includes right angle rotation (dimension swapping/d-swap).
Coded mostly from my Android phone using C4droid.

FEATURES:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - random
  - random solved
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first (Prim)
  - hunt & kill
- Maze sovling algorithms:
  - depth-first
  - breadth-first
- Dimesion swapping (rotation)
- Multiple print styles:
  - "line-of-sight"
  - "ranged"
  - "discovery"

TO DO:
- Maze building algorithms:
  - Eller
- Tutorials:
  - entering commands (press enter)
  - movement
  - dimension swapping

FOR FULL VERSION:
- Windowed
- Real-time controls
- 3D graphics*
- 3D intersection with convex hull algorithm*

* Already implemented elsewhere**.
** And if you believe that, I have a proof for a^n + b^n != c^n for natural a,b,c and n > 2 that's too big to fit here.
